#+TITLE: How to Debug Kernel Quickly
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil

* Background

Before knowing this trick, if we want to debug kernel, we have to
invoke
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ make V=s -j4
#+END_SRC

Though with the multi-thread support, it is still time consuming.


* Trick

We can only build the kernel with the command below:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ make target/linux/{compile,install} V=s
#+END_SRC

E.g. we build qcom ipq4029, after the build process. There is file
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ bin/ipq806x/openwrt-ipq806x-ipq40xx-ubi-root.img
#+END_SRC

generated. Then we can burn it in uboot for quickly kernel debug
task.
