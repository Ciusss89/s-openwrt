** inode
The inode is a data structure in a Unix-style file system that
describes a file-system object such as a file or a directory.
Each inode stores the attributes and disk block location(s) of
the object's data. File-Directories are lists of names assigned
to inodes. A directory contains an entry for itself, its parent,
and each of its children.
