#+TITLE: Fix Issue with no space left on device
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil

* Reference
+ https://www.maketecheasier.com/fix-linux-no-space-left-on-device-error/

* Describe
I came across following issue while sysupgrade.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  /sbin/sysupgrade: line 10: can't create /etc/upgrade111: No space left on device
#+END_SRC

* check du and df
Before you go any further, it's a good idea to check that
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  root@aaa:~# df -h
#+END_SRC

* Possible Causes
** Big File
Maybe some big .pcap file stored in /root!

** Deleted File Reserved by Process
Occasionally, a file will be deleted, but a process is still using
it. Linux won't release the storage associated with the file while
the process is still running. You just need to find the process
and restart it.

Try to locate the process.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  lsof / | grep deleted
#+END_SRC

** Not Enough Inodes
*** reproduce script
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  #!/bin/sh

  k=0
  mkdir /.tmp/a
  while [ 1 -lt 10000 ]; do
          k=`expr $k + 1`
          touch /.tmp/a/$k
  done
#+END_SRC 

After a while, error occures:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  touch: /.tmp/a/6001: No space left on device
#+END_SRC

*** Command to find inode used
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  for i in /*; do echo $i; find $i |wc -l | sort ; done
#+END_SRC
