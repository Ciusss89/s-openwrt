#+TITLE: Fix Issue with core block openwrt boot
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil

* Description
AP cannot boot normally.

* Fix Solution
remove core before execute in /etc/init.d/boot
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cd /etc/uci-defaults || return 0
  [ -f core ] && rm core
  files="$(ls)"
  [ -z "$files" ] && return 0
#+END_SRC


* Reason
If /etc/init.d/boot invokes scripts under /etc/uci-defaults/, and 
We enabled the core dump in /etc/rc.common script
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ulimit -c 1024
#+END_SRC

The code in the /etc/uci-defaults/ scripts may trigger a core file
under /etc/uci-defaults.

Most of the time, the core file will not block the AP booting.

But *probably* an evil core file will block the AP booting. And block each reboot, power boot.

Only firstboot, or remove it can recover the device.
